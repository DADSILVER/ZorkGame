### How To Win The Game
Welcome to my zort game. You are the captain of an underwater base located in the depths of the Mariana Trench, that studies algae and living beings in the area. Together with your colleagues, Dolores and Jonny, you have discovered an algae that may have the ability to cure cancer.
While you are sleeping peacefully in your cabin, you hear a loud noise and screams of "HELP!" that seems to come from the crew room.

From here, your story begins:

You should go check on your colleagues in the crew room. You can talk to them to ask how they are.
You will need to find a diving suit to get to the infirmary. Do not forget that you have to go out of the underwater base, so you will need something to guide you in the darkness.
To get the diving suit, you will need to unlock the workroom using the cardkey.
Head to the ocean, don't forget to equip the suit and the headlantern.
If you don't have the headlantern equipped, something is going to hurt you in the dark.
Head to the infirmary through depressurization chamber number 2.
Kill the stranger to get the bandages.
Give them to Dolores so that she can heal Jonny and save his life.

If you die the game will be over.
